    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    1C:6D:E3:2C:56:0E:DB:C5:C2:EF:C1:12:8B:09:67:62:C7:32:0C:59;com.example.daniel.gmapp

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
